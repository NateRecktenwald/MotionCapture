# MotionCapture
Takes motion capture data from a public library of animation and applies the motion to a created skeleton bone structure by using matrix transformation, scaling, and rotation.\
\
How transformations can be composed in a hierarchy to create a scene graph and, in this case, an animated character within a scene graph.\
How transformations can be used to scale, rotate, and translate basic shapes (unit cubes, spheres, cylinders, and cones) into more complex scenes and characters.\
How mocap data can be used and manipulated in multiple ways to create different types of animations. For example:\
How to create a looping animation that smoothly interpolates between the beginning of the motion clip and the end to avoid any discontinuities.\
How to overlay new motion clips onto a character at runtime, for example, making your character jump in a game when you press a button, or in our case, perform one of a series of cool ballet moves.\
How to read and extend some fairly sophisticated computer graphics code.
